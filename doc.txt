To run the chatbot on local machine:

1. Uncomment nltk.download('punkt') in nltk_utils.py (if running for the first time)
2. Download pytorch from https://pytorch.org/ using customizations as required.
I have downloaded Pytorch on windows using following command for testing the chatbot-
pip3 install torch==1.8.2+cpu torchvision==0.9.2+cpu torchaudio===0.8.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/lts/1.8/torch_lts.html
3.Run train.py using python train.py, 
File called data.pth will be generated, and epoch iteration with corresponding loss will be visible
